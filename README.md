> A library of smart element wrappers for rapidly building rich websites using JavaScript alone

An experimental shift in perspective regarding what defined web development and how to use its capabilities in other ways than _standard_.  

This library takes a more _Flash_ approach to web development, and uses simple JavaScript to directly manipulate DOM-elements in a controversial manner.  

Inspired by the works of agencies awarded for their highly interactive experiences.
